# wordle

I created this WORDLE game so that I could learn more about python whilst having a set goal in mind. 
I coded this on a raspberry pi so there may be errors on other systems, however there shouldn't be.
I hope you like this game.

IMPORTANT NOTE!
You must install the nltk package (via pip) for this game to work.
I included the nltk_data folder, however it may not work, so try use pip to install locally.
